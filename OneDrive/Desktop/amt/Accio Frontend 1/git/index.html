    <h1>Version Control System</h1>
    <p>What is version control?
        A version control system (VCS), allows you to track changes to your code over time. It's essential for developers who often need to work on the same codebase concurrently. It gives them a way to undo mistakes, track changes, and collaborate with others on code. However, anyone who regularly works with files that change can benefit from using version control.
        
        There are many version control systems offered, but Git is by far the most popular. In 2018, a survey of more than 100,000 developers found that Git was the VCS used by 78.0% of respondents. This is because Git is a distributed version control system, which means that it doesn't rely on a central server. This makes Git more flexible than other VCSs, and it's also why Git is the VCS of choice for open-source projects.
        
        VCS allows developers to access the project's history in order to find answers to questions such as: What changes were made? Who made them? When did they occur? What was the purpose of the modifications?</p>


        <h1>What is git</h1>
        <p>Git is the most popular VCS in use today, created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It is free, open-source, and designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Its flexible architecture means it can be effectively integrated into your workflow. For example, you can use Git to manage all your project's files or just a few files that are important to you.</p>

    <h1>Git VS Github</h1>
    <p>Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories. In simple terms, you can use git without Github, but you cannot use GitHub without Git. Take note of the following illustration for further information on the distinctions between the two.

        Basic Git Commands  
A Git command is a string of text that tells Git what to do. Each Git command does a different task, but they all work together to help developers manage their code changes.

Here are some common git commands:
<br>
<span >git init:</span> Initialize a new git repository. This is the first command you should run when starting a new project.
<br>
<span >git clone</span>:  Clone an existing git repository. This command allows you to create a local copy of a remote repository.
<br>
<span >git add: </span>Add files to a repository. This command allows you to add new files or changes to already existing files to a git repository.
<br>
<span >git commit:</span> Make changes to a repository. This command saves your changes to the git history.
<br>

<span >git push:</span> Push changes to a git remote repository. This command pushes your local commits to a remote git repository.
<br>

<span >git pull:</span> Pull changes from a git remote repository. This command pulls down any remote changes and incorporates them into your local git repository.
<br>

<span >git status :</span> Check the status of your git repository. This will let you know which files have been modified and which files are being tracked by git.
<br>

<span >git log: </span>View the commit history for your git repository. This is useful for finding out when certain changes were made and who made them.
<br>
<span >git reset</span>:  Reset your git repository to a specific commit. This command allows you to undo changes to a file or reset your git history.
